Example Description

This example describes how to use GPIO read/write mbed api to generate a pulse and to measure the pulse width.

Requirement Components:
    a wire

HS
Pin name PH_0 and PH_1 map to GPIOH_0 and GPIOH_1:
 - PH_1 as the interrupt GPIO pin with no pull (High-Z).
 - PH_0 as output to generate a pulse.
 - Use a wire to connect PH_0 and PH_1 

LS
Pin name PA_2 and PA_3 map to GPIOA_2 and GPIOA_3:
 - PA_3 as the interrupt GPIO pin with no pull (High-Z).
 - PA_2 as output to generate a pulse.
 - Use a wire to connect PA_2 and PA_3 

In this example, the UART consol will print out the measured width (in us) of the pulse which generated by the interrupt GPIO pin.
